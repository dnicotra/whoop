- System audio dependencies (see installation below)

## Installation

### Windows

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. Install Python dependencies:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Audio System Setup:**
   - Ensure your microphone is connected and working
   - Check Windows Sound settings (Right-click sound icon ‚Üí "Open Sound settings")
   - Make sure microphone privacy settings allow desktop apps to access microphone
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí "Let desktop apps access your microphone"

### macOS

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Audio permissions may be requested when first running the app

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. Install system dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk pulseaudio portaudio19-dev
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python3 audio_recorder.py
```

On Windows, you can also use:
```cmd
python audio_recorder.py
```

### How to use:
1. Enter your name in the text field
2. **Choose your preferred recording duration (1-30 seconds)**
3. **Watch the volume meter to ensure your microphone is working**
4. Click "Start Recording"
5. Wait for the 3-second countdown
6. **Speak for the selected duration when recording starts**
7. The recording will be saved automatically in the `recordings/` directory
8. **Click "Play Last Recording" to listen to your recording**
9. **View all recordings in the list below**
10. **Double-click any recording in the list to play it**
11. **Select recordings and use "Delete Selected" to remove unwanted files**

## Troubleshooting

### Windows-Specific Issues

**"No audio input devices detected":**
- Check that your microphone is plugged in and recognized by Windows
- Go to Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Sound ‚Üí Input ‚Üí Make sure your microphone is listed and working
- Test your microphone using Windows Voice Recorder app first

**"Recording failed" errors:**
- Ensure Python has microphone permissions
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí Allow desktop apps
- Try running as administrator if permission issues persist
- Check that no other applications are using the microphone exclusively

**GUI scaling issues on high-DPI displays:**
- The app includes DPI awareness for better scaling on Windows
- If text appears too small/large, check Windows display scaling settings

**Permission errors when saving files:**
- Make sure the application has write permissions in its directory
- Try running from a folder in your user directory (not Program Files)

### General Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError" for sounddevice or numpy:**
```cmd
pip install --upgrade sounddevice numpy
```

**Audio latency or quality issues:**
- Close other audio applications
- Check system audio settings and sample rate
- Try different microphone input sources

## File Structure

- `audio_recorder.py` - Main application file with cross-platform compatibility
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `run_windows.bat` - Windows batch file for easy startup (double-click to run)
- `test_windows_compatibility.py` - Windows compatibility testing script
- `recordings/` - Directory where audio files are saved (created automatically)

## Windows-Specific Features

This application includes several Windows-specific enhancements:

- **DPI Awareness**: Automatic high-DPI display scaling support
- **Filename Sanitization**: Handles Windows reserved names (CON, PRN, etc.) and invalid characters
- **Audio Permission Checking**: Detects and provides guidance for microphone permission issues
- **Batch File Launcher**: `run_windows.bat` for easy startup without command line
